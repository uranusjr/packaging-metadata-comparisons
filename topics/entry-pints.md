# Entry Points

## Goals

To have a way to let the user, after installing the package, can invoke a certain function in it without necessarily knowing where and how the function is declared or implemented.

The most common form of this functionality are console scripts, in which an executable is created, which invokes the specified function in the specified environment when executed.

## Non-goals

Since this document is about packaging, it will not discuss *project* scripts, i.e. alias-like declarations to let a project developer invoke certain command easily, e.g. package.jsonâ€™s `scripts` field.

## Comparisons
